# ORTHOSCOPE_STAR   

An analysis pipeline to infer orthologous/paralogous relationships for a focal gene.   
ORTHOSCOPE* (star) is an analysis pipelie to infer evolutionary history of a gene. By estimating orthogroups and gene trees, it infer sister group of a species group and gene duplication events on the species tree. Its code is derived from the [ORTHOSCOPE web version](https://github.com/jun-inoue/orthoscope).

# ORTHOSCOPE_STAR (480Mb)   
ORTHOSCOPE* (star) is an analysis pipelie to infer evolutionary history of a gene. By estimating orthogroups and gene trees for a complete set of protein coding genes, ORTHOSCOPE* evaluates a sister group of a focal species group and identifies gene duplication events on the species tree. The code is derived from the [ORTHOSCOPE web version](https://github.com/jun-inoue/orthoscope). ORTHOSCOPE* is designed to use supercomputer for genome scale analyses.

# ORTHOSCOPE_STAR    

## FELIX STATUS

The scripts run, but there is an __error__ in the pal2nal step because the annotated CDS and AA files from Thomas does not correspond perfectly codon-by-codon. The CDS sequences are likely the full genomic sequences with UTRs and all, and that is what's causing the error. The solution would be to trim away any non-coding CDS positions.

ORTHOSCOPE* (star) is an analysis pipelie to infer evolutionary history of a gene. By estimating orthogroups and gene trees for a complete set of protein coding genes, ORTHOSCOPE* evaluates: 

- gene duplication events on the species tree,
- prensence/abnsence of genes in species lineages    
â€‚(including horizontal gene transfer).   
  
The code is derived from the [ORTHOSCOPE web version](https://github.com/jun-inoue/orthoscope). ORTHOSCOPE* is designed to employ supercomputers (High Performance Computers) for genome scale analyses.

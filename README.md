ORTHOSCOPE* (star) is an analysis pipelie to infer evolutionary history of a gene. By estimating orthogroups and gene trees for a complete set of protein coding genes, ORTHOSCOPE* evaluates: 

- a sister group of a focal species group,
- gene duplication events on the species tree,
- prensence/abnsence of genes in species lineages    
â€‚(including horizontal gene transfer).   
  
The code is derived from the [ORTHOSCOPE web version](https://github.com/jun-inoue/orthoscope). ORTHOSCOPE* is designed to employ supercomputers (High Performance Computers) for genome scale analyses.

ORTHOSCOPE* (star) is an analysis pipelie to infer evolutionary history of a gene. By estimating orthogroups and gene trees for a complete set of protein coding genes, ORTHOSCOPE* evaluates: 

- gene duplication events on the species tree,
- prensence/abnsence of genes in species lineages    
â€‚(including horizontal gene transfer).   
  
The code is derived from the [ORTHOSCOPE web version](https://github.com/jun-inoue/orthoscope). ORTHOSCOPE* is designed to employ supercomputers (High Performance Computers) for genome scale analyses.

ORTHOSCOPE (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/3/621/5229933" target="_blank">Inoue and Satoh 2019</a>) is a web tool to identify orthogroup members (orthologs and paralogs, see below) of a specific protein-coding gene of animals and plants. By uploading gene sequences of interest and by selecting species genomes from >600 animals/plants, users can infer their functions and copy numbers, according to results reported by ORTHOSCOPE in the form of gene trees.
<br><br>
By using sequences collected by the BLAST search, ORTHOSCOPE estimates the gene tree, compares it with the <a href="https://github.com/jun-inoue/Species_tree" target="_blank">species tree</a>, and identifies an orthogroup.
<br><br>
ORTHOSCOPE works only for a specific molecule and does not allow genome-scale analyses. Recently I developed the downloaded version, <a href="https://github.com/jun-inoue/ORTHOSCOPE_STAR" target="_blank">ORTHOSCOPE*</a> (star). This analytic pipeline accommodates genome-wide data of protein-coding genes and infers genome-scale events.

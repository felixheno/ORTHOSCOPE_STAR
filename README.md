# ORTHOSCOPE_STAR   
ORTHOSCOPE* (star) is an analysis pipelie to infer evolutionary history of a gene. By estimating orthogroups and gene trees for a complete set of protein coding genes, ORTHOSCOPE* infers sister group of a focal species group and gene duplication events on the species tree. The code is derived from the [ORTHOSCOPE web version](https://github.com/jun-inoue/orthoscope).
